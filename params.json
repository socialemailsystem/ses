{"name":"Social eMail System","tagline":"Beyond social network and mail.","body":"### What’s SeS?\r\n\r\nSeS is intended to be a new paradigm in Internet communication.\r\nIt tries to take the best of email, social networks and Instant messaging to bring users a whole new web social experience.\r\nSeS is a fully free, open-source and decentralized social network, that’s to say there isn’t a huge farm of servers ruled by one big company that owns all your data.\r\nEverybody can install its own SeS server in a minute - you only need a standard Linux / Apache / MySQL / PHP host. Or, you can just register on an existing server and have fun.\r\nIn any way, all SeS servers are connected into the SeS Network, and you can communicate with people from any server.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Let’s SeMail it.\r\n\r\nThe main concept behind SeS is the SeMail.\r\nIt’s a kind of real-time email conversation with strong social aspects. It could also be considered as a little cousin of Google Wave... without the bloat.\r\n\r\nThere are three types of SeMails:\r\n\r\n**Public SeMail**\r\n\r\nA public SeMail is like a blog or social network publication. It can be seen and answered by your followers or by anyone who has the SeMail’s ID / URL. With a Public SeMail, you can tell to the world how legendary your holidays was, write a review about the last film you saw or launch an exciting debate about the life of polar bears in North Pole. It’s up to you.\r\n\r\n**On invite SeMail**\r\n\r\nAn On invite SeMail looks like an instant messenger conversation with several people. Everyone can invite new participants.\r\nUse it to discuss in real time with your friends, office mates, family,...\r\n\r\n**Private SeMail**\r\n\r\nA private SeMail is more like an email, perfect for \"serious business\" usages, with predefined participants.\r\nOnly the owner can invite new people. This allows you to have a greater control on the conversation, and to prevent overflows.\r\n\r\n\r\nNevertheless, ALL of them are BOTH \"real-time\" AND \"delayed\" messaging systems. In other words, it's possible to use the same SeMail in a real-time way as you would with an IM ; or to send messages that will be read and answered later.\r\n\r\nAlso note that all these SeMails can be set as Read Only, that is to say only the creator can send messages. Ideal for sharing some news without being spammed, maintaining a public or private flow of informations about your company or organization, etc.\r\n\r\nAt last, your messages aren't plain text, since you can use BBCode to format them (bold, italic, colors, images, links, columns, smileys,...).\r\nHere is [a list](http://nbbc.sourceforge.net/doc/bbc.html) of all available BBCode tags: \r\n\r\n\r\n### Following system and Feeds\r\n\r\nLike most social networks, SeS allows you to follow other users.\r\nLast Public SeMails of people you're following will form the Feed. Moreover, when you create an On invite or a Private SeMail, your contacts list enables you to select participants much more easily than by manually typing in their addresses.\r\n\r\nBut, contrary to most social networks which are \"friends-centered\", SeS is fully  \"Open space\": contacts are only here for bookmarking. You don't have to be in the contact list of someone to communicate with him / her. Only his / her address is necessary... as you would do with a mail.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Interoperate with the world\r\n\r\nObviously, SeS - and especially Public SeMails - has to integrate with the existing.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, it offers you a few ways to spread content:\r\n\r\n**RSS Feeds**\r\n\r\nThere are two types of feeds.\r\nThe first one is the User Feed, available through the Profile, which lists the last Public SeMails of somebody.\r\nThe second one is the SeMail Feed, enumerating the last messages of a Public SeMail, and which can be accessed via its “Share It”  window.\r\nA feed can then be utilized by an aggregator. For example, you could subscribe to a User Feed with the RSS reader which is included in Mozilla Firefox, and be automatically warned every time this person post a new SeMail.\r\n\r\n**Public SeMail URL**\r\n\r\nThe “Share It” window also provides a link which allows everybody to display a Public SeMail, without the need to be logged on any SeS server. Useful to share your prose on other social networks, by mail, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\nTo summarize, in addition to its own innovative concepts, SeS takes elements from three very different worlds.\r\n\r\n**Social Networks**\r\n\r\n* Following system.\r\n* Feeds.\r\n* Public conversations with shareable IDs.\r\n* Meet new people and socialize.\r\n* Tagging system (#mySubject, #myOtherSubject,...).\r\n* Profiles.\r\n* ...\r\n\r\n**Instant Messaging**\r\n\r\n* Chat in real-time.\r\n* Invite people to conversations.\r\n* A SeMail = a window.\r\n* ...\r\n\r\n**eMail**\r\n\r\n* Free (as in Freedom) and decentralized.\r\n* \"Open space\" VS friends-centered, only needs the SeMail address (someone::myserver.lt) to communicate.\r\n* Delayed conversations.\r\n* No censorship: a sent message is a sent message (but you can delete your Public SeMails).\r\n* ...\r\n\r\n\r\n### Web hosting\r\n\r\nUnlike most other social networks, SeS can be setup on a “classical” web hosting service. In other words, you don’t need to get your own (and expensive !) dedicated server with a bunch of specific software: a simple “shared” web hosting with PHP and MySQL will be fine.\r\n\r\nSeS has been tested on:\r\n\r\n* OVH (shared web hosting plan)\r\n\r\n→ Test on: http://testpolitique.fr/ses/client/index.php\r\n\r\n* C-WebHosting (free shared web hosting)\r\n\r\n→ Test on: http://semail.c-wh.org/ses/client/index.php\r\n\r\n* XAMPP\r\n\r\n→ http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html\r\n\r\n* [ Please contact us if you successfully tested SeS on an other one ! ]\r\n\r\n\r\n### Licensing\r\n\r\nSeS is a Free Software, licensed under the GNU Affero General Public Licence Version 3.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html\r\n\r\n![agpl](http://www.gnu.org/graphics/agplv3-155x51.png)\r\n","google":"UA-42097506-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
