Social eMail System
===
Version 0.1




*** Beyond social network and mail ***

SeS is intended to be a new paradigm in Internet communication.
It tries to take the best of email, social networks and instant messaging to bring users a whole new web social experience.
SeS is a completely free, open-source and decentralized social network, that is to say it doesn't rely on a huge farm of servers ruled by one big company who owns all your data.
You can install your own SeS server in minutes with just a standard Linux / Apache / MySQL / PHP host, or you can simply register on an existing server and have fun.
All SeS servers are connected into the SeS Network, and you can communicate with anyone regardless of their server.
