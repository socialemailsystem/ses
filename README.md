*** Beyond social network and mail ***


SeS is intended to be a new paradigm in Internet communication.
It tries to take the best of email, social networks and Instant messaging to bring users a whole new web social experience.
SeS is a fully free, open-source and decentralized social network, that’s to say there isn’t a huge farm of servers ruled by one big company that owns all your data.
Everybody can install its own SeS server in a minute - you only need a standard Linux / Apache / MySQL / PHP host. Or, you can just register on an existing server and have fun.
In any way, all SeS servers are connected into the SeS Network, and you can communicate with people from any server.
